# GraphDeAnonymization
In this project, you are requested to utilize graph anonymization algorithms to solve seed based de-anonymization and seed free deanonymization . In the seed based de-anonymization dataset, there are two graph files (G1.edgelist and G2.edgelist) and a seed node pairs file. The graphs are given in edgelist filetype. Each row in G*.edgelist represents an edge connectting two nodes. For example, the first row in G1.edgelist &lt;0 330> means there is an edge between node 0 and node 330 in Graph 1. The seed node pairs file (seed_node_pairs.txt) gives some matched node seed pairs. In the file seed_node_pairs.txt, the first column refers the node number in G1 and the second column refers the node number in G2. For example, in the first row of seed_node_pairs.txt, &lt;0 3389> means the node 0 in Graph 1 is mapped to node 3389 in Graph 2. Given those mappted seed paris in seed_node_pairs.txt and two graphs, the project ask you to output the full nodes paris between Graph 1 and Graph 2. Please output a full node pairs (Same format as seed_node_pairs.txt) considering the seed pairs. In the seed free de-anonymization data, there are only two graphs given in edgelist filetype (unseed_G1.edgelist and unseed_G2.edgelist). You need to match the node in unseed_G1 to the node in unseed_G2 without seed node pairs. The output format is simlar to Seed based De-anonymization one
